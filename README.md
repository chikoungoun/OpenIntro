## OpenIntro

  My Rendition of the open intro book for statistics knowledge enhancement and pandas framework application.
  In this project, I am trying to chapters and modeling all the datas using python and the associated data science framework (Pandas, numpy, matplotlib,...)
  In this project, we are going to go through the book, rephrase the big concepts in easy words to grasp the science of statistics but also use the data science tools to code the examples and develop functions to automatize the calculation of statistics and probability formulas.
